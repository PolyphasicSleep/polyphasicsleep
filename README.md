# polyphasicsleep.github.io
This is a static website providing general information about Polyphasic Sleep. It is my first attempt at creating a website.
It is hosted by GitHub Pages and mapped to [polyphasicsleep.tk](https://www.polyphasicsleep.tk) with a CNAME record.

I am currently working on a PHP-based successor with more functionality, such as customizable sleep schedules linked to a personal account.
This project can be found [here](https://github.com/PolyphasicSleep/PHPolySleep).
